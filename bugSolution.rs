Several solutions are available, depending on what's intended:

1. **Single Mutable Reference:**  Only one mutable reference should point to the data at a time.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    {
        let y = &mut x; // y is a mutable reference to x
        *y = 10; // Modifying x through y
    }
    println!("{}", x); // Prints 10
}
```

2. **Interior Mutability:** If mutability is still needed, using `RefCell` or `Mutex` enables it within a shared reference context.

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

fn main() {
    let x = RefCell::new(5);
    let y = &x;
    *y.borrow_mut() = 10; // Modify through shared reference using borrow_mut()
    println!("{}", *y.borrow()); // Prints 10
}
```

3. **Clone:** If data can be easily cloned, create copies instead of sharing a single mutable reference.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    let mut y = x.clone(); // Clone the value
    y = 10;
    println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y); // x: 5, y: 10
}
```
Choosing the best solution depends on the specific use case. The key is to avoid multiple mutable borrows simultaneously.
